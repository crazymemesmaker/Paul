# Rules

Rules are really important phrases that everyone needs to read before doing something: because it makes people understand what they need to do without ruining something.

## Copyright - Rule 1

**What is copyright?**

Copyright is a real important right that says that you can't copy a other guy creation and making it your own, like stealing.

**Why is copyright important?**

Because then after someone steals your creation making it its own, people thinks that the original creator is who stealed it, getting the stealed creation popular, instead of the original game.

## Be appropriate and avoid hate - Rule 2

**Why i can't spread the hate or not do a innapropriate fan cretion?**

Hate and not appropriate things, that everyone can do with a game can ruin a lot of the game experience, so please if you hate don't say it or spread and to your fan creations be appropriate.

## Read this before doing something:

**What can i do with this game?**

1- **Mods and fan games:**

Mods and fan games are ok but they need to be not copies, and have credits to the original creator that it's me **Sportfly**.

2- **Fan animations or arts:**

That is also ok with credits to this game and me and please do appropriate things because i don't want to suffer my eyes on something horrible you do, so be sure on the description or title to put the credits to this game and me, and be appropriate avoiding cringe.

3- **Posts or comments:**

That is ok because it spreads the game making it popular, but they need to be not hate comments, if you hate this game it's ok but don't spread the hate or don't just say it.
